      <h3> What </h3>
      <p> Adoptr is built to aggregate animal data from shelters around the UK. Inspired by Battersea, we aim to provide the user 
      a quicker, clearer way to see which animals are available for adoption at any one time, while adding accessible links for 
      donations to come in to the shelters themselves.</p>
